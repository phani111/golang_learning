func listing1() {
a := []int{0, 1, 2}

for i, v := range a {
a[2] = 10
if i == 2 {
fmt.Println(v)

The code being explained is the `listing1()` function.

This function demonstrates how the range loop in Go works with arrays, particularly focusing on how the loop's variables behave when the array is modified during iteration.

The function doesn't take any inputs and doesn't directly return any outputs, but it does print a value to the console.

Here's what the function does:

It starts by creating an array `a` with three integer values: `0`, `1`, and `2`.

Then, it begins a `for` loop that uses the `range` keyword to iterate over the array. In each iteration, `i` represents the current index, and `v` represents the value at that index.

Inside the loop, it immediately changes the last element of the array (index `2`) to `10`. This happens in every iteration of the loop.

There's an `if` statement that checks if the current index (`i`) is `2` (the last index of the array). When this condition is true, it prints the value of `v`.

The purpose of this code is to illustrate that the range loop in Go creates a copy of the array it's iterating over at the start of the loop. This means that even though the array is modified inside the loop (setting `a[2] = 10`), the values of `v` in each iteration remain unchanged from the original array.

As a result, when the loop reaches the last index (`2`), it prints the original value at that index (`2`), not the modified value (`10`). This might be surprising to beginners who expect the loop to reflect changes made to the array during iteration.

This code helps to demonstrate an important concept in Go: the behavior of range loops with arrays and how they handle modifications to the iterated data structure during the loop execution.
