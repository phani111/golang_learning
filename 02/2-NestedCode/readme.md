## Purpose of the Code
The main goal of this code is to join two input strings into one and ensure that the resulting string does not exceed a specified maximum length. Additionally, it provides a way to handle cases where one or both input strings might be empty.

### Inputs
The code takes the following inputs:

- Two strings (`s1` and `s2`) that you want to concatenate.
- An integer (`max`) that specifies the maximum allowed length of the resulting concatenated string.

### Outputs
The code produces:

- A concatenated string that is either the full concatenation of `s1` and `s2` or a truncated version of it if the length exceeds the specified maximum.
- An error message if either of the input strings is empty.

### How It Achieves Its Purpose
The code achieves its purpose through three main functions:

- `join(s1, s2 string, max int) (string, error)`: This function concatenates the two input strings and ensures the result does not exceed the specified maximum length. If either input string is empty, it returns an error.
- `correctUsage(s1, s2 string, max int) (string, error)`: This function is similar to `join` but handles empty input strings more gracefully. Instead of returning an error, it returns the non-empty string truncated to the maximum length.
- `concatenate(s1, s2 string) (string, error)`: This helper function simply concatenates the two input strings and returns the result.

### Important Logic Flows and Data Transformations
- **Error Handling for Empty Strings**: Both `join` and `correctUsage` check if either `s1` or `s2` is empty. If an empty string is found, `join` returns an error, while `correctUsage` handles it by returning the non-empty string truncated to the maximum length.
- **Concatenation**: The `concatenate` function is called to combine `s1` and `s2` into one string.
- **Length Check and Truncation**: After concatenation, both `join` and `correctUsage` check if the length of the resulting string exceeds the specified maximum length. If it does, the string is truncated to the maximum length.
