You're encountering a naming collision because you're using the same name (`list`) for both the package import and the variable. This can lead to confusion and errors because the compiler can't distinguish between the package and the variable.

### Problem Explanation


list := list.New()


Here, `list` is being used as a variable name, which shadows the imported package name `list`. After this line, `list` refers to the variable, not the package, causing a collision.

To avoid this naming collision, you can use a different name for the variable. Here are a few ways to resolve this:

1. **Rename the Variable**
2. **Alias the Package Import**
